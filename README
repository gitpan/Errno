This distribution generates a Errno package which will define and
optionally export all E* constants defined in your system <errno.h>
file.

The Errno.pm included in the distribution will be over-written by an
auto-generated one when you run

	perl Makefile.PL

The only reason it is included is so that CPAN.pm can find the package.
